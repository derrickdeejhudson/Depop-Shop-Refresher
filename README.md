pyautogui - https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Currently works with 1440p resolution monitors for the mouse clicks.
Everything else is keyboard inputs.
Only tested in Google Chrome.

Scroll to the bottom of your unsold listings aligning the bottom row of images with the bottom of your window as close as possible. Start the script and watch your shop refresh automatically!

If you notice all of your tabs are loaded and are waiting unnecessarily long, try messing with the duration of the sleep() functions.

Depending on the size of your shop you can reduce or remove the entire outtermost while loop.
